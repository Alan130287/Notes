# How to Read a Paper

标签（空格分隔）： Learning PaperReview

### The First Pass 
Read paper for several reasons
1. To review them for a conference or a class
2. To keep current in their field
3. For a literature survey of a new field

The three-pass approach
1. First Pass: get a bird's-eye view of the paper
2. Second Pass: read the paper with grater care, but ignore details such as proofs. 
3. Third Pass: to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: The paper teach you how to read a paper and take note.
2. `Context`: Related paper not found. Base on time management and attention machanism.
3. `Correctness`: Assumption Valid.
4. `Contribution`: Help me how to read paper efficiently.
5. `Clarity`: YES

### The Second Pass
#### First Pass:
1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the `five Cs`:
1. `Category`: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. `Context`: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. `Correctness`: Do the assumption appear to be valid?
4. `Contribution`: What are the paper's main contribution?
5. `Clarity`: Is the paper well written?

The Above information will help you decide whether to read further

#### The Second Pass
Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs. You can note down the terms you `don't understand` or `question` you want to ask about the author.
1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations of the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading(this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper)

This part usually takes `1 hour`. After this pass, you should be able to 
1. grasp the content of paper
2. summerize the main trust of the paper with supporting evidence

Sometimes you don't understand the paper even at the end of second pass, because:
* the subject matter is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acroyms
* the author use a proof or experimental technique that you don't understand 
* The article may be poorly written with unsubstantiated assertions and numerous forward references`? what is forward reference`.
* You are tired.

You can choose to :
1. set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career.
2. return to the paper later, perhaps after reading the background material
3. persevere and go on to the third pass

#### The Third Pass
To attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: making the same assumption as the author and re-create the work.
1. Identify the innovations 
2. Hidden failings and assumptions
3. Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement
4. Think about how yourself would present a particular idea
5. Jot down ideas for future work
6. Be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper in memory
7. Identify strong and weak points
8. Pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work and potential issues
9. Future reading

#### Doing a Literature Survey in a New Field
1. Use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent highly-cited papers in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey, you are done. Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck.
2. In the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they've published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.
3. The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.

#### Future reading
If you are reading a paper to do a review, you should also read Timothy Roscoe's paper on "Writing reviews for systems conferences" [^3]. If you're planning to write a technical paper, you should refer both to Henning Schulzrinne's comprehensive web site [^4] and George Whitesides's excellent overview of the process [^5]. Finally, Simon Peyton Jones has a website that covers the entire spectrum of research skills[^2].
Iain H. McLean of Psychology, Inc. has put together a downloadable `review matrix' that simplifies paper reviewing using the three-pass approach for papers in experimental psychology[^1], which can probably be used, with minor modifications, for papers in other areas.


### Third Pass

`Template of Paper Review` is finished.

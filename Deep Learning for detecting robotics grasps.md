[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: A new method to determine where to grasp.
2. `Context`: 
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: Present a two-step cascaded structure with two deep networksf and a method to apply structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization.  
5. `Clarity`: 


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.

# RUDDER: Return Decomposition for Delayed Rewards(Read it later with 10 pass)

---

[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: The creation of RUDDER method and comparison to previous methods. 
2. `Context`: All the papers about value function in reinforcement learning.
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: RUDDER, a reward decomposition method, which creates a new MDP with same optimal policies as original MDP but with redistributed rewards that have largely reduced delay.
5. `Clarity`: Well written.


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.

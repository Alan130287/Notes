[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: An approach to the integration of task planning and motion planning that is aggressively hierarchical.
2. `Context`: STRIPS(STanford Research Institute Problem Solver)
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: The hierarchical integration of task planning and motion planning that make choices and commits to them in a top-down fashion in an attempt to limit the length of plans that need to be constructed and thereby exponentially decrease the amount of search require.
5. `Clarity`:

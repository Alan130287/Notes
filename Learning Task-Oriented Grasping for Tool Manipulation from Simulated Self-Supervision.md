[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: A research prototype of task-oriented grasping.
2. `Context`: so many.
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: 
 * Propose a learning-based model for jointly learning task-oriented grasping and tool manipulation that directly optimizes task success.
 * To train the model, it develop a mechanism for generating large scale simulated self-supervision with large repository of procedually generated 3D objects.`?`
 * The model can generalize to using novel objects as tools in both simulation and real world.
5. `Clarity`: Is the paper well written?


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.

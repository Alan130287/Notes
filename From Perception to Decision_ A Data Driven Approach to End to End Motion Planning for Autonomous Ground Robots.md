[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: raw 2-D-laser range findings and a target position -> steering commands for the robot 
2. `Context`: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. `Correctness`: Do the assumption appear to be valid?
4. `Contribution`: 
 * A data driven end-to-end motion planner from laser range findings to motion commands
 * Development and test on a real robotic platform in unknown environment
 * Extensive evaluation and comparison of presented local approach with respect to a motion planner with global map information. 
5. `Clarity`: Is the paper well written?


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.

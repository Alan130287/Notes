4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. `Context`: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. `Correctness`: Do the assumption appear to be valid?
4. `Contribution`: What are the paper's main contribution?
5. `Clarity`: Is the paper well written?


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.

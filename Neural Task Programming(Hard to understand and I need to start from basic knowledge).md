[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: A new architecture called Neural Task Programming can generalize to variations of task length, task topology and task semantics.
2. `Context`: So many.
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: A novel modeling framework: NTP that enables meta-learning on hierarchical tasks. 
5. `Clarity`: 


## Second Pass
> Read the paper with greater care but ignore details such as proofs.
### Questions:
* Finite State Machine(FSM)
* Neural Program Induction
* Neural Programmer-Interpreter(NPI)
* LSTM networks


### Unread References
* The whole references in chapter of related work.

### The Content of Paper(Roughly)


### The Main Trust of Paper with Supporting Evidence

## Third Pass
> To attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: making the same assumption as the author and re-create the work.

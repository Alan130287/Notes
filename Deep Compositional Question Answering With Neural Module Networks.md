[TOC]

## First Pass
> 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3. Glance at the mathematical content to determine the underlying theoretical fundations
4. Read the conclusions
5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.

`Five Cs`:
1. `Category`: Neural Module Network for visual question answering
2. `Context`: 
3. `Correctness`: 
4. `Contribution`: Simultaneously exploit the representational capacity of deep networks and the compositional linguistic structure of questions.
5. `Clarity`:
